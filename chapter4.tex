\chapter{Data Analysis}
In the analysis of experimental data, the primary goal is to extract a differential cross section for Coulomb dissociation of $^{17}$B as a function of relative energy between $^{15}$B and two neutrons. To achieve the goal, I will describe the procedure of identifying the secondary beam of ${}^{17}$B, and selecting events involving the fragment ${}^{15}$B and two neutrons. The flow of the data analysis is as follows.

\begin{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select the event containing ${}^{17}$B beam by beam particle identification
        \item Select the event containing ${}^{15}$B fragment by fragment particle identification
        \item Select the event containing two neutrons by cross-talk analysis
        \item Extract the 2$n$ removal cross section of the ${}^{17}\text{B} \to {}^{15}\text{B} + 2n$ reaction
        \item Reconstruct invariant mass at target and obtain the relative energy spectrum 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{center}

\section{Secondary Beam Particle Identification}

The identification of the ${}^{17}$B secondary beam was performed using the TOF-$B\rho$-$\Delta E$ method. Time of Flight (TOF) is obtained from time difference between scintillator at F7 and F13, $B\rho$ is calculated from the beam passing $x$ position at F5, and $\Delta E$ is measured from ionization chamber ICB. $A/Z$ and $Z$ of the secondary beam is driven by the following equation.

\begin{align}
    &\beta_{\text{TOF}_{\text{F7-F13}}} = L(\text{F7-F13}) / ( {\text{TOF}}_{\text{F7-F13}} \times c )\\
    &\beta_{\text{F5}} = f(\text{TOF}_{\text{F7-F13}})\\
    &A/Z = \frac{c \times B\rho_{\text{F5}} \times \gamma_{\text{F5}} }{ m_u \times \beta_{\text{F5}}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    Z = \beta_{\text{F7-F13}} \sqrt{\Delta E_{\text{ICB}} \bigg\{ 0.307075 \cdot \Delta x \bigg(\frac{Z_{\text{P10}}}{A_{\text{P10}}}\bigg) \ln \bigg( \frac{2m_{e}c^{2}\beta_{\text{F7-F13}}^{2}\gamma_{\text{F7-F13}}^{2}}{I_{\text{P10}}} - \beta_{\text{F7-F13}}^{2}\bigg) \bigg\}^{-1} }
\end{align}
$L(\text{F7-F13})$ is a distance between F7 and F13 scintillator, $f(\text{TOF}_{\text{F7-F13}})$ is 2nd order polynomial function of TOF for fitting $\beta_{\text{F5}}$. $\Delta E_{\text{ICB}}$ is total energy loss at ICB and $Z_{\text{P10}}$, $A_{\text{P10}}$ and $I_{\text{P10}}$ are effective atomic number, effective mass number and mean excitation energy of P10 gas. $\Delta x$ is a travel distance in ICB. The detail of each steps are described in following.

\subsection{Time of Flight}
The Time of Flight (TOF) is measured using the time difference between two plastic scintillators. In the present analysis, from the timing at F7 plastic scintillator ($t_{\text{F7}}$) and the ones from SBT1,2 at F13 ($t_{\text{SBT1}}$, $t_{\text{SBT2}}$), the TOF$_{\text{F7}-\text{F13}}$ is obtained by following equation.
    \begin{align}
        \text{TOF}_{\text{F7-F13}} = \frac{t_{\text{SBT1}} + t_{\text{SBT2}}}{2} - t_{\text{F7}} + \Delta t_{offset}
    \end{align}
$\Delta t_{offset}$ is the offset used to correct for the difference between the actual measured $\text{TOF}_{\text{F7-F13}}$ and the calculated TOF value with the consideration of energy loss at the materials between F7 and F13. The calculated $\text{TOF}_{\text{F7-F13}}$ value is 192.34 ns, and the corresponding $\Delta t_{offset}$ value is 172.03 ns.

\subsection{Magnetic Rigidity}
Magnetic Rigidity $B\rho$ is derived by Beam Projection Chamber (BPC) located at F5 dispersive focal plane. The $x$ position of a beam passing through F5 is measured by BPC, and the $B\rho$ is calculated using the following equation.
    \begin{align}
        B\rho = (1+\frac{x}{D}) B\rho_{0} 
    \end{align}
with the rigidity of the central trajectory $B\rho_{0}$ is 8.780 Tm, and  momentum dispersion $D$ is 3300 mm/$\%$. 

\subsection{Energy Loss}
The energy loss $\Delta E$ is measured in the Ionize Chamber for Beam (ICB). The correlation between $\Delta E$ and $Z$ can be obtained according to the simplified Bethe-Bloch's energy loss formula as follows.
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta x} = 2\pi N_{a} r_{e}^{2} m_{e} c^{2} \rho_{\text{P10}} 
        \bigg( \frac{Z_{\text{P10}}}{A_{\text{P10}}} \bigg) \bigg( \frac{Z^{2}}{\beta^{2}} \bigg) 
        \left[ \ln \frac{2m_{e}c^{2}\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}}{I_{\text{P10}}} - \beta^{2}  \right]
    \end{align}
with
    \begin{align}
        2 \pi N_{a} r_{e}^{2} m_{e} c^{2} \rho_{\text{P10}} = 0.307075 \text{ MeV cm}^{2} \text{g}^{-1} 
    \end{align}
    \begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{}
        $N_{a}$ : Avogadro's number = 6.022 $\times$ 10$^{23}$\\
        $r_{e}$ : classical electron radius = 2.817 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm\\ 
        $m_{e}$ : electron mass = 0.511 MeV/c$^{2}$\\
        $\rho_{\text{P10}}$ : density of the P10 gas = 1.84 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ g/cm$^{3}$\\
        $Z_{\text{P10}}$ : effective atomic number of the P10 gas\\
        $A_{\text{P10}}$ : effective mass number of the P10 gas\\
        $I_{\text{P10}}$ : mean excitation energy of the P10 gas\\ 
        $\beta$ = $v / c$ of the beam particle\\
        $\gamma$ = $1 / \sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}$
    \end{adjustwidth}
\vspace{3mm}
In this formula, the density effect correction $\delta$ or shell correction $C$ are skipped. Since the P10 gas is compound of 90$\%$ Ar and 10$\%$ CH$_{4}$, the mean excitation energy $I_{\text{P10}}$ is calculated as described in the Appendix A.
The travel distance in ICB, which is calculated as (total length of ICB) $\times$ (probability of each gas in P10) $\times$ (volume density).
\begin{align}
    \Delta x &= 51\times0.9\times0.0016608 + 51\times0.1\times0.000667 
\end{align}

\subsection{Beam Particle Identification}
Figure \ref{fig:Beam_PID} shows the histogram of the particle identification of the secondary beam, showing $Z$ versus $A/Z$. The total numbers of the secondary beam for each target is summarized in Table \ref{tab:Beam_PID}.

\section{Beam Profile at Target}

The beam profile at the target can be determined using the two drift chambers, BDC1 and BDC2, located upstream of the target. The incident position and angle at the target are obtained from the beam positions at BDC1 and BDC2.

\subsection{BDC Calibration}
The BDC drift chamber is designed for tracking the incident particle. Beam particle trajectory is obtained by following procedure.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obtain a drift time from TDC distribution.
    \item Extract a hit position of each layer from STC (Space to Time Conversion) function.
    \item Fit the trajectory with the linear function by the least-square method.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{TDC (Time to Digital Converter) Distribution}
The timing information of the BDC is obtained by TDC (Time to Digital Converter). In figure \ref{fig:TDC_BDCs}, the TDC distribution of BDC1 and BDC2 are shown. Since we used common stop mode to take a TDC data in this experiment, the drift time is,
\begin{align}
    t_{drift} = t_{max} - t_{\text{TDC}}
\end{align}
where $t_{max}$ is the maximum TDC value. This TDC distribution is obtained from run 431 with $\pm$ 5mm slit at F5. 

\subsubsection{STC (Space to Time Conversion) Function}
The distance between hit position to an anode wire is given by space time conversion (STC) from the drift time. Assuming the uniform position distribution in each drift length cell as
\begin{align}
    \frac{dN}{dx} = const.  
\end{align}
The STC function is derived by integrating the TDC distribution as,
\begin{align}
    &\frac{dN}{dt} \cdot \frac{dt}{dx} = const.\\
    &dx = C \cdot \frac{dN}{dt} \cdot dt,\\
    &x(t) = C \cdot \int_{t_{0}}^{t} \frac{dN}{dt} dt \label{eq:stc}
\end{align}
where, C is normalization factor, $t_0$ is the minimum drift time and $t$ is the drift time from TDC distribution. 
The integration range of TDC for each BDC is shown in table \ref{tab:TDC_BDCs}. The upper and lower limit is determined by the TDC distribution. (Figure \ref{fig:TDC_BDCs}) 
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
        \hline
        &Lower limit [ch]& Upper limit [ch]\\
        \hline
        BDC1&640&760\\
        BDC2&630&750\\        
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[TDC integration ranges of BDCs]{TDC integration ranges of BDC1 and BDC2}

    \caption[TDC Distribution of BDCs]{TDC Distribution of BDC1 (left) and BDC2 (right)}
    \label{fig:TDC_BDCs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Linear fitting of trajectory}
After getting the STC function, the hit position of each layer is calculated from drift time as eq. (\ref{eq:stc}). Now we can get the trajectory of beam particle by fitting the hit position with linear function. When fitting the trajectory, the least-square method is used. The least-square method is the method of finding the best fit of a set of hit positions by minimizing the $\chi^2$ value. The $\chi^2$ value is defined as,
\begin{align}
    \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{(x_{i} - f(x_{fit}))^2}{\sigma_{i}^2}
\end{align}
where, $x_{i}$ is the hit position of each layer, $f(x_{fit})$ is the position from fitting function, $\sigma_{i}$ is the position resolution of each layer.

\subsubsection{The resolution of BDCs}
After tracking the trajectory, the resolution of BDCs can be evaluated by the tracking residue distribution. The tracking residue $x_{residue}$ is defined as,

\begin{align}
    x_{residue} = x_{trac} - x_{drift}
\end{align}

where $x_{trac}$ is the calculated position from the trajectory and $x_{drift}$ is the hit position of each layer. The tracking residue distribution of BDC1 and BDC2 are shown in Figure \ref{fig:residue_bdcs}. The width of residue distribution for $x$ and $y$ direction are $\Delta x$ = 0.2605 mm, $\Delta y$ = 0.2632 mm respectively. From this, the position and angular resolution are calculated as described in the Appendix B. The result is described in table \ref{tab:resolution_bdcs}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Beam Profile at Target}
The beam profile at the target is obtained by using the position information from BDCs. The position information ($x_{\text{tgt}}$, $y_{\text{tgt}}$) and angle information ($a_{\text{tgt}}$, $b_{\text{tgt}}$) at the target are obtained as,

\begin{align}
    x_{\text{tgt}} &= x_{\text{BDC1}} + \frac{(x_{\text{BDC2}} - x_{\text{BDC1}})}{L(\text{BDC1} - \text{BDC2})} \times L(\text{BDC1} - \text{tgt})\\
    y_{\text{tgt}} &= y_{\text{BDC1}} + \frac{(y_{\text{BDC2}} - y_{\text{BDC1}})}{L(\text{BDC1} - \text{BDC2})} \times L(\text{BDC1} - \text{tgt})\\
    a_{\text{tgt}} &= tan^{-1} \bigg( \frac{(x_{\text{BDC2}} - x_{\text{BDC1}})}{L(\text{BDC1} - \text{BDC2})} \bigg)\\
    b_{\text{tgt}} &= tan^{-1} \bigg( \frac{(y_{\text{BDC2}} - y_{\text{BDC1}})}{L(\text{BDC1} - \text{BDC2})} \bigg),
\end{align}
where the distance between BDCs is $L(\text{BDC1} - \text{BDC2}) = 999.3 $mm, and the distance between BDC1 and the target is $L(\text{BDC1} - \text{tgt}) = 2017.1$mm. The beam profile at the target is shown in Figure \ref{fig:beam_profile_tgt}.

\begin{align}
    \Delta \theta_x^{\text{tgt}} = \Delta \bigg( \frac{x_{\text{BDC2}} - x_{\text{BDC1}}}{L(\text{BDC2} - \text{BDC1})} \bigg) 
    = \frac{\sqrt{(\Delta x_{\text{BDC2}})^2 + (\Delta x_{\text{BDC1}})^2}}{1000 \text{mm}} \\ \notag
    \Delta \theta^{\text{tgt}}_y = \Delta \Big( \frac{y_{\text{BDC2}} - y_{\text{BDC1}}}{L(\text{BDC2} - \text{BDC1})} \Big) 
    = \frac{\sqrt{(\Delta y_{\text{BDC2}})^2 + (\Delta y_{\text{BDC1}})^2}}{1000 \text{mm}}
\end{align}
The position resolution at the target is
\begin{align}
    \Delta x_{\text{tgt}} = \sqrt{(\Delta x_{\text{BDC2}})^2 + (\Delta \theta_x^{\text{tgt}} \cdot L(\text{tgt} - \text{BDC2}))^2} \\ \notag
    \Delta y_{\text{tgt}} = \sqrt{(\Delta y_{\text{BDC2}})^2 + (\Delta \theta_y^{\text{tgt}} \cdot L(\text{tgt} - \text{BDC2}))^2}
\end{align}

\section{Charged Particle Identification}

Charged particles are identified using the TOF-B$\rho$-$\Delta$E method as same as the beam particle identification. Time of Flight is obtained from time difference between target and HODF, $B\rho$ is calculated from FDC1 and FDC2 positions and angles, and $Z$ is calculated by HOD $Q$ information. $A/Z$ and $Z$ is obtained by the following equation.

\begin{align}
    &\beta_{\text{frag}} = L(\text{tgt - HODF}) / ( {\text{TOF}}_{\text{tgt - HODF}} \times c )\\
    &A/Z = \frac{c \times B\rho \times \gamma_{\text{frag}}} { m_u \times \beta_{\text{frag}}}\\
    &Z = p_0 + p_1 (Q_{\text{HOD}} - p_2 \frac{1}{\beta^2})
\end{align}

$L$(tgt - HODF) is flight length from target to HODF. This is also calculated by a function of the positions and angles at FDC1 and FDC2 as the one for $B\rho$. The coefficient of $Z$ calculation $p_0, p_1, p_2$ are obtained by linear fitting of HOD $Q$ distribution. The detail of each steps will be described in following.

\subsection{FDC Calibration}
The tracking procedure of FDCs is same as BDC. The integration range of TDC for each FDC is shown in table \ref{tab:TDC_FDCs} And the TDC distribution for determining the upper and lower limit are shown in Figure \ref{fig:TDC_FDCs}.

\subsubsection{The resolution of FDCs}
The residue distribution of each $X$, $U$, $V$ plane is shown in Figure \ref{fig:residue_fdcs}. The width of residue distribution for $x$ and $y$ direction are $\Delta x$ = 0.2605 mm, $\Delta y$ = 0.2632 mm respectively. From this, the position and angular resolution are calculated as described in the Appendix B. The result is described in table \ref{tab:resolution_fdcs}.

    \label{fig:residue_fdcs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Magnetic Rigidity}
The Brho of the charged particle is calculated from the positions and angles obtained from FDC1 and FDC2. 
\begin{align}
    B\rho &= f(x_{\text{FDC1}}, y_{\text{FDC1}}, a_{\text{FDC1}}, b_{\text{FDC1}}, x_{\text{FDC2}}, a_{\text{FDC2}})\\
    &= \sum_{i} c_{1,i} a_i + \sum_{i}\sum_{j} c_{2,ij} a_i a_j + \sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k} c_{3,ijk} a_i a_j a_k + \cdots \\
    &= c_{1,0} x_{\text{FDC1}} + c_{1,1} y_{\text{FDC1}} + \cdots + c_{2,00} x_{\text{FDC1}}^2 + c_{2,01} x_{\text{FDC1}} y_{\text{FDC1}} + \cdots + c_{3,000} x_{\text{FDC1}}^3 + \cdots
\end{align}
The function of B$\rho$ is extracted by using TMultiDimFit class in ROOT using a trajectory obtained from Geant4 simulation.
\begin{align}
    &a_{\text{FDC1}} = tan^{-1} \bigg( \frac{x_{\text{FDC1}} - x_{\text{tgt}}}{L(\text{FDC1} - \text{target})} \bigg)\\
    &b_{\text{FDC1}} = tan^{-1} \bigg( \frac{y_{\text{FDC1}} - y_{\text{tgt}}}{L(\text{FDC1 - target})} \bigg)
\end{align}

\subsection{Time of Flight and Energy Loss}
\subsubsection{Time of Flight}
Time of flight of charged particle is determined by the time difference between the HODF and the target. The time at target is determined by addition of the time at F13 and the time of flight from F13 to the target. The time of flight between F13 and the target is calculated with ${}1^{17}$B beam with Energy loss calculation considered the material between F13 and the target. The time of flight between HOD and target is defined by the following equation.

\begin{align}
    t_{\text{tgt}} = t_{F13} + tof_{\text{F13-tgt}}
    tof_{\text{HODF-tgt}} = t_{\text{HODF}} - t_{\text{tgt}} + \Delta t_{offset}
\end{align}
where $t_{\text{HOD}}$ is timing information of HODF and $\Delta t_{offset}$ is obtained by Geant4 simulation as same as B$\rho$ analysis. The $\Delta t_{offset}$ is 112.5256 ns.

\subsubsection{Energy Loss}
In case of fragment, the energy loss is obtained from the light output information of HODF scintillator. From the Bethe-Bloch formula, we assumed that 
\begin{align}
    Z_{frag} \propto \beta_{frag} \sqrt{\Delta E} = \beta_{frag} \sqrt{Q_{\text{HOD}}}
\end{align}
Because of the proportional relation between $Z_{frag}$ and $\sqrt{Q_{\text{HOD}}}$, it is difficult to identify the fragment particle by only energy loss information. So first we gate the fragment particle by ${}^{17}$B beam, and assumed that most of fragment came from ${}^{17}$B should be ${}^{17}$B itself. Then we can get coefficient for calculating the Z.
\begin{align}
\end{align}

\subsection{Fragment Particle Identification}
The fragment particle identification is shown in figure \ref{fig:fragpid_all} and \ref{fig:fragpid_b17}. Figure \ref{fig:fragpid_all} is the fragment particle identification of all events. Figure \ref{fig:fragpid_b17} is the fragment particle identification only from ${}^{17}$B beam events.

\section{Analysis of Neutrons}
In this experiment, neutrons emitted from the secondary beam ${}^{17}$B are detected by the NEBULA neutron detector array. A neutron is detected indirectly by recoiled proton which is mainly produced by H($n$,$n$) and ${}^{12}$C($n$,$np$) reaction in the plastic scintillator. Because of the indirect detection of neutrons, the selection of neutron events is more complicated than that of charged particles. The selection of neutron events is performed in three steps. First, reject the events which are considered to be a charged particle or gamma event. Second, in two neutron selection case, remove the event which is considered to be a cross-talk. After all, select the fastest and second fastest event as a real neutron event. In following section, the detail of each step is described.

\subsection {Selection of Real Neutron Events}
%In the selection procedure of real neutron event, the rejection of charged particle and gamma ray is almost same with one neutron selection. But in case of selecting events of two neutrons, the most important process is the elimination of cross-talk. Cross-talk refers to the phenomenon where a single neutron generates multiple signals. Cross-talk is the most significant source of noise when selecting two-neutron events. The selection of two neutron events is performed in five steps. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All events detected by the first VETO are considered to be charged particles and are rejected.
    \item Among the events detected by NEBULA, events with a light output Q of less than 6 MeVee are considered to be gamma rays and are rejected. In addition, events exceeding the maximum energy loss of a recoiled proton in one scintillator unit (130 MeV) are also rejected.
    \item Events whose TOF from the target to the first wall is less than 40 ns and whose TOF from the target to the second wall is less than 42 ns are considered to be non-neutron events with $\beta < 0.9$ and are rejected.
    \item (For the selection of two neutron events) For events detected at the second VETO, detections in which the two fastest neutron events incident on the second NEUT wall are dr(xy) $<$ 500mm and 1ns $<$ dt $<$ 5ns are considered to be cluster scattering events from second VETO and the second event is rejected.
    \item (For the selection of two neutron events) Cross-talk events are rejected.
\end{enumerate}
I will describe the three step of cross-talk rejection.

\subsection{Cross-talk Rejection}
To reject cross-talk, a Geant4 simulation was performed to generate events of ${}^{16}\text{B} \to {}^{15}\text{B}+n$, thereby replicating cases where all two-neutron events are due to cross-talk. The details of the executed Geant4 simulation are shown in Table \ref{tab:cross-talk_sim}.

\subsubsection{Clustering event}
The clustering event means the two events which are detected in very close distance in very small time interval. It means the second event is likely to be a recoil proton from the first event. The clustering event is rejected by the following condition.

\begin{align}
    \bigg( \frac{dr-dr_0}{3\sigma_{dr}} \bigg)^2 + \bigg( \frac{dt-dt_0}{3\sigma_{dt}} \bigg)^2 < 1 
\end{align}
where $dr$ and $dt$ are the position and time difference between two events. And $dr_0$ and $dt_0$, $\sigma_{dr}$ and $\sigma_{dt}$ mean the central values and the standard deviations of the distribution of $dr$ and $dt$ for the clustering events. The $dr_0$ and $dt_0$ are 98.35 mm and 0.65 ns, and $\sigma_{dr}$ and $\sigma_{dt}$ are 71.07 mm and 0.40 ns. 

\subsubsection{same wall event}
For the rejection of cross talk in the case of two event is hit on the same wall, the relative velocity between the events is used. After the selection of two neutron events, each event is tagged by the hit order. The light output is tagged as $Q_1$ and the one of second event is tagged as $Q_2$. The relative velocity between two events is defined as $\beta_{01}/\beta{12}$ where $\beta_{01}$ represents the velocity between first hit and the target and $\beta_{12}$ represents the velocity between first and second hit. Figure 00 shows the distribution of light output of second event $Q_2$ with the function of relative velocity $\beta_{01}/\beta{12}$.

In the figure, the events with $\beta_{01}/\beta_{12} > 1$ are considered to be cross-talk events because the scattered neutron from first hit is considered to be slower than the first hit. Also, the ev

\subsection{Cross-talk Residual Rate}
Even though we performed the cross talk rejection, there probably be residual of cross talk. For each cross talk step, we evaluated the residual rate of cross talk. Each step is as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (a) no rejection
    \item (b) clustering rejection
    \item (c) clustering rejection + same wall rejection
    \item (d) clustering rejection + same wall rejection + gamma rejection
\end{enumerate}
The residual rate of cross talk can be calculated by the following formula.
\begin{align}
    R = \frac{N_{M>2}}{N_{M>1}}
\end{align}
The result is the multiplicity M $\>$ event is 225385, and M>2 event of each step and residual rate R are in table 4.7.

        (a) & 89721 (39.8$\%$) & 10123 (4.5$\%$) & 99844 (44.3$\%$) \\

        (d) & 5352 (2.4$\%$)& 2089 (0.9$\%$)& 7441 (3.3$\%$)\\

\section{Acceptance and Efficiency Correction}
For evaluating the two-neutron detection efficiency and SAMURAI acceptance, the simulation is performed by Geant4. The information of simulation is as follows.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}[h]{c|c}
        \hline
        Physics Model & Phase Space Decay \\
        Reaction & ${}^{17}\text{B} \to {}^{15}\text{B} + 2n$\\
        Beam Energy & 270 MeV/u\\
        Relative Energy & 1-10 MeV (Uniformly generated)\\
        Scattering Angle & 0-30 mrad (Uniformly generated)\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The result of simulation is shown in figure \ref{fig:acc_same_diff}.

\section{Reconstruction of Invariant Mass}

After identification of all fragments from the ${}^{17}$B beam, the invariant mass of the system can be reconstructed. First, the beam vector is reconstructed by $\beta_{\text{Beam}}$ and beam profile at target. $\beta_{\text{Beam}}$ is calculated using Eloss code, considering the energy loss from F5 slit to the middle of target.

\begin{align}
    %\gamma_{\text{Beam}} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{\text{Beam}}^{2}}}\\
    P_z ({}^{17}\text{B}) &=  m_{{}^{17}\text{B}} \gamma \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ \tan^2(\text{tgt}a)+ \tan^2(\text{tgt}b)}}\\
    P_x ({}^{17}\text{B}) &=  P_z ({}^{17}\text{B}) \cdot \tan(\text{tgt}a)\\ 
    P_y ({}^{17}\text{B}) &=  P_z ({}^{17}\text{B}) \cdot \tan(\text{tgt}b)
\end{align}

Second, the momentum of the ${}^{15}$B fragment is calculated from the 
\begin{align}
    \vec{P} ({}^{15}\text{B}) &= B\rho c Z \\
    E ({}^{15}\text{B}) &= \sqrt{m({}^{15}\text{B})^{2} + P({}^{15}\text{B})^{2}}\\
    \vec{P_z} ({}^{15}\text{B}) &= \vec{P} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \tan^2(scata)+ \tan^2(scatb)}}\\
    \vec{P_x} ({}^{15}\text{B}) &= \vec{P_z} ({}^{15}\text{B}) \cdot \tan(scata)\\
    \vec{P_y} ({}^{15}\text{B}) &= \vec{P_z} ({}^{15}\text{B}) \cdot \tan(scatb)
\end{align}
Finally the neutron vector is reconstructed by the position information from NEBULA and the time-of-flight as (4.34). From these three vectors, the invariant mass of the system is calculated.
The momentum $P(n)$ of the neutron is reconstructed from the detection position in NEBULA relative to the target, and the time-of-flight (TOF). The momentum vector of the neutron is described as follows.

\begin{align}
    L &= | \vec{r}_{\text{tgt}} - \vec{r}_{n} | \\
    \beta_{n} &= L / (\text{TOF}_{\text{NEB-tgt}} \times c) \\
    P_{n} &= m_{n} \beta_{n} \gamma_{n} \\
    E_{n} &= m_{n} \gamma_{n} \\
    \vec{P_{n}} &= \frac{\vec{r_{n}} - \vec{r_{tgt}}}{L} P_{n}
\end{align}
where, $\vec{r}_{\text{tgt}}$ is the position of the target $\vec{r}_{\text{tgt}}$, $m_{n}$ is the neutron mass
