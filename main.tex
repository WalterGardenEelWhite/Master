\chapter*{Abstract}
Neutron-rich isotopes have drawn much attraction in recent years due to its structural properties such as neutron halo: one or two neutrons in the nucleus are weakly bound and are spatially extended far from the core nucleus. Borromean nuclei are particularly interesting due to the two-neutron halo structure. The Borromean nucleus is a bound three-body system, where any of its two-body subsystems are unbound. Experimental data of 2n halo structure have been reported for ${}^{6}$He, ${}^{11}$Li, and ${}^{19}$B. These 2n halo nuclei show a dineutron correlation, a spatially compact neutron pair, and the recent Coulomb dissociation of ${}^{19}$B revealed the dineutron in ${}^{19}$B. My thesis work focuses on ${}^{17}$B, which is also considered as a 2n halo nucleus. ${}^{17}$B is the core of the 2n halo nucleus ${}^{19}$B but ${}^{17}$B itself is the 2n halo nucleus. Investigating a dineutron correlation in ${}^{17}$B will give us a critical information about multi-neutron halo structure in neutron-rich isotopes. \newline
To investigate two neutron halo structure including the dineutron correlation in ${}^{17}$B, the Coulomb dissociation experiment was performed at SAMURAI (Superconducting Analyzer for MUlti particles from RAdio Isotope beams) spectrometer at RIBF (Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory), RIKEN. A 48Ca primary beam accelerated to 345 MeV per nucleon was incident on a primary Be target to produce a ${}^{17}$B secondary beam. The generated secondary beam was separated and identified by BigRIPS fragment separator and was incident on a secondary Pb target where ${}^{17}$B is dissociated into 15B and two neutrons. The charged fragment 15B was detected by the SAMURAI spectrometer, while the two neutrons were detected by the neutron detector array NEBULA to measure Coulomb dissociation exclusive cross sections. The two neutron removal cross sections on carbon and lead targets were extracted and the Coulomb Dissociation spectrum of ${}^{17}$B was obtained from the relative energy spectrum between 15B and two neutrons.
