\chapter*{Abstract}
Recent studies on neutron-rich isotopes have highlighted their distinctive two- neutron (2n) halo structure, where halo neutrons are weakly bound and spatially extended from the core. This research studies the 2n halo nucleus 17B, which can also be the core of 19B, to understand its implications for multi-neutron halo structures and dineutron correlation. Using the SAMURAI spectrometer at RIBF, RIKEN, a 48Ca primary beam on a Be target produced the 17B secondary beam. This beam was dissociated into 15B and two neutrons on a Pb target. The 15B fragment and the neutrons were detected by the heavy-ion detectors and neutron detector array NEBULA, respectively, at SAMURAI, RIBF. We successfully extracted the two-neutron removal cross sections 733±8 (stat.) mb for lead target and 191±3 (stat.) mb for carbon target and constructed the relative energy spectrum between 15B and two neutrons using the invariant mass method. This result yielded a spectrum of the reduced transition probability for electric dipole, B(E1) distribution, with the photon equivalent method and Coulomb Dissociation cross sections spectrum. The obtained B(E1) spectrum has wider width and smaller strength compared to that of 19B, indicating the hindered halo structure of 17B
