\chapter{Experiment}
    This chapter describes about experimental setup in this study. The experiment is performed at Rare Isotope Beam Factory (RIBF) at RIKEN Nishina Center.\cite{RIKEN} A primary ${}^{48}$Ca beam is produced by the RIKEN accelerator complex and delivered to the BigRIPS separator. \cite{Kubo03} \cite{Kubo07} \cite{Kubo12} The BigRIPS separator produced the ${}^{17}$B secondary beam which bombarded on the lead and carbon targets in front of the SAMURAI (Superconducting Analyzer for MUlti-particles from Radioisotope beams) spectrometer. \cite{SAMURAI} After the reaction at target, the fragments ${}^{15}$B and two neutrons are detected by detectors at SAMURAI area. Note that this experiment was part of the SAMURAI Dayone experiment which was the first physics run using the SAMURAI spectrometer.

After primary ${}^{48}$Ca beam is produced at SRC accelerator, the beam bombarded on a 30mm thick Be target and the secondary beam is produced through the in-flight fragmentation method. Since the secondary beam includes many rare isotopes, the RI beam is separated by the BigRIPS separator. Table 3.1 shows the BigRIPS separator setup for Dayone experiment. In the first stage of BigRIPS separator, the RI beam separated by dipole magnet with slit and wedge-shaped degrader located at F1 focal plane. In the dipole magnet, the rigidity of a particle can be written as following eq \ref{eq:rigidity}.
    \begin{align}
        \rho = \frac{A}{Z} \cdot\frac{v}{B} \label{eq:rigidity}
    \end{align}
The velocity of the secondary beam is almost same regardless of the nuclei so that it can be possible to choose specific $A/Z$ by adjusting the slit to filter only some $B\rho$ value. After that, the wedge-shaped degrader makes the beam energy depends on the $Z$ so that even same $A/Z$ nuclei can be separated. In the second stage, the RI beam is identified using TOF-B$\rho$-$\Delta E$ method. Each detector information will be described as following.

The SAMURAI spectrometer is designed for kinematically complete experiment such as invariant mass spectroscopy. \cite{SAMURAIConcept} Charged fragment bent by SAMURAI superconducting magnet and detected by two drift chambers (FDC1, FDC2) and one plastic scintillator (HODF). Two drift chamber for fragment are located at before and after SAMURAI magnet, for rigidity analysis. And plastic scintillator HODF is placed after FDC2 to measure the TOF and energy loss of fragment. Finally the neutron detector array NEBULA is located at the end of extended beam line for neutron detection. Using SAMURAI system, the invariant mass of the system can be reconstructed by measuring all of the fragments and neutrons.
